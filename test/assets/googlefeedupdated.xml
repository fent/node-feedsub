        <title type="text">S’more to love across all your screens</title>
        <content type="html">From your watch to your phone to your TV, we want to help you stay connected, entertained and informed across all your screens. Today we’re introducing a few new things that do just that: two Nexus phones, a tablet for work and play, updates to Chromecast and features for some of your favorite apps—all working together to make your day a little bit easier and more fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RFOcaNS3JRQ/VgqhGYRZMXI/AAAAAAAARM4/Q684n8gAt5Y/s1600/HARDWARE-MONTAGE_V1b_NW_cropped.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="360" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RFOcaNS3JRQ/VgqhGYRZMXI/AAAAAAAARM4/Q684n8gAt5Y/s640/HARDWARE-MONTAGE_V1b_NW_cropped.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Nexus phones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made Android to be an open platform that anyone can build on, and today there are 4,000+ Android devices in all shapes and sizes. Android’s diversity is why it’s become the most popular mobile platform in the world, and the latest version, &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/versions/marshmallow-6-0/"&gt;Marshmallow&lt;/a&gt;, takes Android to a new level of performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we love all the Android devices out there, every year we build &lt;a href="http://google.com/nexus"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; devices to show off the latest and greatest, directly from the people who built Android. Today we’re introducing the latest Nexus treats, both running Marshmallow, sweetened by amazing apps and sandwiched by some cutting-edge hardware (see what we did there?):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4cAHL4LMNlY"&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt; is the first all-metal-body Nexus phone. Built in collaboration with Huawei, this 5.7” phone is crafted from aeronautical-grade aluminum, with a USB Type-C port for fast charging, a powerful 64-bit processor, and a 12.3 MP camera sensor with massive 1.55µm pixels (hello, better photos!). The Nexus 6P starts at $499.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re not the only one who misses your Nexus 5. We’ve joined forces with LG to bring it back with the new &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QLqHZLdt_jE"&gt;Nexus 5X&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you great performance in a compact and light package, with a beautiful 5.2” screen and the same 12.3 MP camera and Type-C port as the Nexus 6P. Nexus 5X starts at $379.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Both phones include a new fingerprint sensor, Nexus Imprint, which gives you quick and secure access to your phone, as well as use of Android Pay (in the U.S.). They are available for pre-order &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?utm_source=gblog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_he&amp;amp;utm_campaign=9_29-launches"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt; from a number of countries, including the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Japan, and come with a free 90-day subscription to Google Play Music. In the U.S., pre-orders include a $50 Play credit to help you stock up your favorite music, apps, games and shows. And, finally, for you Project Fi fans out there, you'll be happy to know Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X will work on your favorite network. Request an invite to our Early Access Program at &lt;a href="http://fi.google.com/"&gt;fi.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yiaZPpDqcyQ/VgrTDAYGyKI/AAAAAAAARNw/Q6rwY-0H4k4/s1600/AN_BH_Groupshot_JH-150908%2B_Alt_Crop.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yiaZPpDqcyQ/VgrTDAYGyKI/AAAAAAAARNw/Q6rwY-0H4k4/s640/AN_BH_Groupshot_JH-150908%2B_Alt_Crop.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pixel C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re expanding the Pixel family by introducing the &lt;a href="http://pixel.google.com/"&gt;first Android tablet built end-to-end by Google&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixel C brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of a tablet. The tablet and keyboard attach magnetically (no docking mechanism FTW), so it’s easy to switch between typing and using the touch screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you’re familiar with the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/"&gt;Chromebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll immediately see the family resemblance: the Pixel C has the same beautiful aluminum design, great display and USB Type-C port. The Pixel C will be available in time for the holidays on the Google Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cast ALL the things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we’re introducing two new Chromecast devices. The new &lt;a href="http://google.com/chromecast"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; has a fresh design, and is easier to plug into TVs with crowded ports. It supports the latest Wi-Fi standards and adapts more easily to changing Wi-Fi conditions in your home, so you get higher quality video with less buffering. Most importantly, we added two new colors. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/chromecast/speakers"&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/a&gt; is a small device that plugs into your existing speakers, so you can stream your favorite music, radio and podcasts over Wi-Fi, similar to Chromecast. It works with tons of apps, including Spotify, Pandora and Google Play Music. Just like Chromecast, it works from anywhere in your home with your favorite devices, including Android, iOS, and laptops. And it’s available &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/tv_and_audio?utm_source=gblog&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_he_2&amp;amp;utm_term=9_29-launches&amp;amp;utm_campaign=9_29-launches"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and other online retailers for just $35—way less than most Wi-Fi speakers today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve also updated the Chromecast app to make it easier for you to find great things to watch or to play, across the thousands of apps that work with Chromecast—whether you feel like browsing or want to search for a specific TV show or movie. For Cast-enabled apps that aren’t already on your phone, we’ll suggest one for you. The updated Chromecast app is rolling out on Android and iOS over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX6Kkq7hPJY" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your favorite apps... for the whole family &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All your shiny devices get even better when you have great apps to go with them. So we’re making a few updates to Google Play Music and Google Photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Google Play Music will offer a new family plan later this year. Up to six people will be able to use one account for a shared fee of $14.99 a month (instead of $9.99 per person). Get the dance party ready. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing is a theme of today’s Google Photos updates, too. We’re adding Chromecast support to give you that old-school slideshow experience—dimmed lights optional. In the U.S., you can now add private labels to your photos to make it easier to search for specific pics of people with things, places or other people—say, that photo of Mom at the Grand Canyon, or of your daughter with her pet bunny. And soon you’ll be able to pool all your photos and videos with friends and family in one place, and get updates as soon as new photos are added. Best of all, there’s no setup involved, and you can use any device. So that dance party we mentioned earlier? Now it’s easier to gather all the memories from everyone who was there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More to love, for more people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Nexus to Chromecast to Pixel C to Photos, these updates are more than the sum of their parts—they unite great apps with devices that are designed to support them. They’re built to work together, so they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;—seamlessly, across all your screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ze-eDJaBz_4/Vgq1JlgjqNI/AAAAAAAARNg/4WWUd5nQp8k/s1600/Fam_Hero_w_Ryu_WHT_BCK.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="414" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ze-eDJaBz_4/Vgq1JlgjqNI/AAAAAAAARNg/4WWUd5nQp8k/s640/Fam_Hero_w_Ryu_WHT_BCK.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Posted by Hiroshi Lockheimer, VP Android, Chromecast and Chrome OS at Google</content>

        <title type="text">Big ideas for an even better Bay Area</title>
        <content type="html">Converting a liquor store into a community-based learning and tutoring center. Providing millions of dollars of 0% interest loans to small businesses. Breaking the poverty- to-prison cycle by building a residential alternative to prison for young adults. This is just a sampling of the big ideas that local nonprofits submitted for our second annual &lt;a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/bayarea2015"&gt;Google Impact Challenge: Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, after reviewing hundreds of submissions, we’re unveiling 10 finalists chosen together with our panel of &lt;a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/bayarea2015"&gt;advisors&lt;/a&gt;—a group that includes the San Francisco Chronicle’s Editor-in-Chief Audrey Cooper, The Golden State Warriors’ Harrison Barnes, The San Francisco Giants’ Hunter Pence, and CEO of the San Francisco Foundation, Fred Blackwell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Representing San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Clara, San Mateo and more, these organizations span the Bay Area. Learn more about these groups and their ideas for change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/b/116899029375914044550/photos/+google/albums/6199756297151772737" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="360" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WGOek2a15lk/Vgn9R43UhFI/AAAAAAAARMc/d81BAvnm6U0/s640/BAIC-PR-header-v-2.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This year, finding and funding new ideas will be just one part of the Google Impact Challenge: Bay Area. We are also reinvesting in a few of our 2014 finalists. &lt;a href="http://ellabakercenter.org/"&gt;The Ella Baker Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/Ze2gZi"&gt;Beyond12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lavamae.org/"&gt;Lava Mae&lt;/a&gt;, and Bay Area Community Resources in collaboration with &lt;a href="http://ifrsf.org/"&gt;Instituto Familiar de la Raza&lt;/a&gt; all were funded last year, and will receive between $250,000 and $1,000,000 in additional funding this year. We’re very pleased to continue supporting organizations focused on homelessness, youth employment, and racial justice—big problems that Google.org works to tackle with local organizations, year-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens next is in your hands! Anyone can vote for the new projects they think will have the most impact on the Bay Area. Again, the top four will receive $500,000 in grant funding, the remaining six will get $250,000 each. 15 additional organizations will each receive $100,000 and all nonprofits will be connected with Googler volunteers and coworking space in San Francisco. We’ll announce winners on October 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To vote, visit &lt;a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/bayarea2015"&gt;g.co/bayareachallenge&lt;/a&gt; or check out &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=zzOdcnQ0BoYA.kXcjsWiOq-4E"&gt;one of our voting stations across the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When creative, socially-conscious minds and the Bay Area’s innovative spirit join forces, big things can happen. Congratulations to all finalists, and best of luck the rest of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by David Drummond, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Alphabet&lt;/span&gt;</content>

        <title type="text">Bring virtual reality field trips to your school with Google Expeditions</title>
        <content type="html">At the Bronx Latin School in New York City, teacher Katrina Roman says the topic of ancient history doesn’t usually set students abuzz. But this week, they took a field trip to ancient Aztec ruins using Google Expeditions, a virtual reality teaching tool built with Google Cardboard. Normally, their assignment would involve poring over photocopied photographs, but instead, they stood at the top of Chichen Itza, then examined detailed carvings at Tenochtitlan. Amid “oohs” and “aahhs,” the students shouted out details they noticed and shot hands up to answer Ms. Roman’s questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N_3EFrC63XM/VglrMSIV2uI/AAAAAAAARL0/PiA5aDEdF3I/s1600/h7kqJxlU3ainv0mEFS8eZaV39UrG6x9jT1VOpZe_29bQrAgDQh_jsBMlkfSGDlRvyr8SdA%253Ds2048.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="426" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N_3EFrC63XM/VglrMSIV2uI/AAAAAAAARL0/PiA5aDEdF3I/s640/h7kqJxlU3ainv0mEFS8eZaV39UrG6x9jT1VOpZe_29bQrAgDQh_jsBMlkfSGDlRvyr8SdA%253Ds2048.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Katrina Roman’s class at the &lt;a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolportals/12/x267/default.htm"&gt;Bronx Latin School&lt;/a&gt; fills out their assignment after visiting Aztec ruins with Expeditions. The class is part of a history and geography pilot with &lt;a href="http://www.newvisions.org/"&gt;New Visions for Public Schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting today, we’re bringing this experience to thousands of schools around the world with the new &lt;a href="http://google.com/edu/expeditions"&gt;Expeditions Pioneer Program&lt;/a&gt;. During the 2015/2016 school year, we’ll be bringing “kits” containing everything a teacher needs to run a virtual trip for their class: &lt;a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Phones/ZenFone_2_ZE551ML/"&gt;ASUS smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet for the teacher to direct the tour, a router that allows Expeditions to run without an Internet connection, and Google &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/"&gt;Cardboard viewers&lt;/a&gt; or Mattel &lt;a href="http://www.view-master.com/"&gt;View-Masters&lt;/a&gt; that turn phones into virtual reality headsets. Although nothing replaces hopping on the bus for a field trip, there are some places that are just out of reach (hello, Chichen Itza!). Virtual reality gives teachers a tool to take students places a school bus can't. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To help teachers learn how to use Expeditions, we’ll be visiting thousands of schools around the world and bringing the kit for teachers to use in their classes for the day. Up first: Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S., followed by more locations as the school year progresses. At each school, our team will show teachers &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlYJdZeA9w4"&gt;how Expeditions works&lt;/a&gt; and help set it up before class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Right now, teachers can choose from a library of 100+ virtual trips to places like Mars, the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Wall of China. But we’re constantly adding more trips with the help of partners like &lt;a href="http://pbs.org/"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;, educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, British documentarian David Attenborough in collaboration with Alchemy VR, and the &lt;a href="http://www.wcs.org/"&gt;Wildlife Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt;. We’re also working with &lt;a href="http://starfishscholars.org/"&gt;the Starfish Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to help students explore future careers by showing them a virtual day in the life of professionals including a veterinarian and computer scientist. And to help students achieve those career goals, we’re working with First Lady Michelle Obama to support her &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/reach-higher"&gt;Reach Higher&lt;/a&gt; initiative by taking students on virtual college tours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mwIuKXmWQbY/VglrMeoi_KI/AAAAAAAARLw/uHPN9dIAyvM/s1600/subaru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mwIuKXmWQbY/VglrMeoi_KI/AAAAAAAARLw/uHPN9dIAyvM/s400/subaru.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And if you see one of these cars on the road, that's us! The folks at Subaru, who invest in education as part of their &lt;a href="http://www.subaru.com/love-promise.html"&gt;Love Promise&lt;/a&gt; initiative, have created a fleet of Expedition Pioneer Program rides that we'll be using to bring kits to schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If visiting Mars, trekking on the Great Wall of China or exploring what it’s like to work at a veterinarian’s office sounds like something your class would be interested in, head to the &lt;a href="http://google.com/edu/expeditions"&gt;Expeditions Pioneer Program site&lt;/a&gt; and sign up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by David Quaid, Software Engineer, Google Expeditions&lt;/span&gt; This post is updated for testing purpose.</content>

        <title type="text">Bringing the Internet to more Indians—starting with 10 million rail passengers a day</title>
        <content type="html">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;When I was a student, I relished the &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps/dir/Chennai,+Tamil+Nadu/IIT+Kharagpur,+Kharagpur,+West+Bengal/@17.6598577,79.110274,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a5265ea4f7d3361:0x6e61a70b6863d433!2m2!1d80.2707184!2d13.0826802!1m5!1m1!1s0x3a1d44031d91072d:0x750e832f90176385!2m2!1d87.3090683!2d22.3145443!3e3"&gt;day-long railway journey&lt;/a&gt; I would make from Chennai Central station (then known as Madras Central) to &lt;a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/"&gt;IIT Kharagpur&lt;/a&gt;. I vividly remember the frenetic energy at the various stations along the way and marveled at the incredible scale and scope of &lt;a href="http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/#mainContent"&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-arxs9XeT3Ic/Vgg7wyvu7vI/AAAAAAAAF04/qs28hFcvQtc/s1600/modi-sundar%2Balt%2Btwitter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="474" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-arxs9XeT3Ic/Vgg7wyvu7vI/AAAAAAAAF04/qs28hFcvQtc/s640/modi-sundar%2Balt%2Btwitter.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Googleplex today&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I’m very proud to announce that it’s the train stations of India that are going to help get millions of people online. In the past year, 100 million people in India started using the Internet for the first time. This means there are now more Internet users in India than in every country in the world aside from China. But what's really astounding is the fact that there are still nearly one billion people in India who aren’t online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’d like to help get these next billion Indians online—so they can access the entire web, and all of its information and opportunity. And not just with any old connection—with fast broadband so they can experience the best of the web. That’s why, today, on the occasion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to our U.S. headquarters, and in line with his Digital India initiative, we announced a new project to provide high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with &lt;a href="http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/"&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/a&gt;, which operates one of the world's largest railway networks, and &lt;a href="http://www.railtelindia.com/"&gt;RailTel&lt;/a&gt;, which provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network along many of these railway lines, our Access &amp;amp; Energy team plans to bring the first stations online in the coming months. The network will expand quickly to cover 100 of the busiest stations in India before the end of 2016, with the remaining stations following in quick succession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with just the first 100 stations online, this project will make Wi-Fi available for the more than 10 million people who pass through every day.  This will rank it as the largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users. It will also be fast—many times faster than what most people in India have access to today, allowing travelers to stream a high definition video while they’re waiting, research their destination, or download some videos, a book or a new game for the journey ahead. Best of all, the service will be free to start, with the long-term goal of making it self-sustainable to allow for expansion to more stations and other places, with RailTel and more partners, in the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lNr0L-MzLpw/VghDQxtOyiI/AAAAAAAAF1I/1fKWd0z_ID4/s1600/IndiaWifi-kash.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="444" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lNr0L-MzLpw/VghDQxtOyiI/AAAAAAAAF1I/1fKWd0z_ID4/s640/IndiaWifi-kash.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This map shows the first 100 stations that will have high-speed Wi-Fi by the end of 2016&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We think this is an important part of making the Internet both accessible and useful for the more than 300 million Indians already online, and the nearly one billion more who are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not the only piece. To help more Indians get access to affordable, high-quality smartphones, which is the primary way most people there access the Internet, we &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.sg/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html"&gt;launched Android One last year&lt;/a&gt;. To help address the challenges of limited bandwidth, we recently &lt;a href="http://googleindia.blogspot.sg/2015/06/faster-and-lighter-mobile-web-pages-in.html"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a feature that makes mobile webpages load faster and with less data, and we’ve made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn1yG6jyTAM"&gt;YouTube available offline&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/io-2015-mobile-revolution.html"&gt;offline Maps coming soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help make web content more useful for Indians, many of whom don’t speak English, we launched the Indian Language Internet Alliance last year to foster more local language content, and have built greater local language support into our products—including Hindi Voice Search, an improved Hindi keyboard and support for seven Indian languages with the latest versions of Android. And finally, to help all Indians reap the benefits of connectivity, we’ve been ramping up &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVx15KEEEs"&gt;efforts to help women&lt;/a&gt;, who make up &lt;a href="http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.in/2014/09/can-internet-enabled-rickshaw-help.html"&gt;just a third&lt;/a&gt; of Internet users in India today, get the most from the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like I did years ago, thousands of young Indians walk through Chennai Central every day, eager to learn, to explore and to seek opportunity.  It’s my hope that this Wi-Fi project will make all these things a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted by Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google&lt;/div&gt; This post is updated for testing purpose.</content>

        <title type="text">Through the Google lens: Search Trends Sept 18–24</title>
        <content type="html">Even if you weren’t trying to keep up with all your fall shows returning, this week was a busy one. Here’s a look at what captured our attention the past seven days—from the Pope to a little rat with a big dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we’re changing up this series, so this will be our last regular Friday post for a while. We’ll be back soon in a different format. Until then, keep on searchin’ on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pizza rat is all of us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s start with the important stuff. This week the Internet was captivated by a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPXUG8q4jKU"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; showing a rat carrying a slice of pizza down the stairs of a New York subway station. There were more than &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pizza+Rat&amp;amp;std=20150921&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150921-Pizza+Rat"&gt;50K+ searches for “Pizza Rat”&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and the 14 second-video has more than 6 million views at last count. But while &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pizza-rat"&gt;#PizzaRat memes&lt;/a&gt; multiplied across the web, New Yorkers had some more unsettling questions in mind, like: “How many rats are in New York?” and “What is the rat to people ratio in New York?” (Are you sure you want to know?) Whether Pizza Rat is a &lt;a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150921/east-village/pizza-rat-is-metaphor-for-life-new-york-city-says-man-who-shot-video"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/pizza-rat-is-no-hero.html"&gt;quitter&lt;/a&gt;, something about him spoke to us. Because in a way, aren’t we all just rats trying to find a slice of pizza in the subway station of life? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iseZs1GHgAo/VgXH1AHQVqI/AAAAAAAARLU/PBmoNLr1Xp0/s1600/PizzaRat%2B%25281%2529.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iseZs1GHgAo/VgXH1AHQVqI/AAAAAAAARLU/PBmoNLr1Xp0/s640/PizzaRat%2B%25281%2529.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/09/23/yogi_berra_and_pope_john_xxiii_a_probably_dialogue.html"&gt;Hello, Pope&lt;/a&gt; Francis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week Pope Francis became the &lt;a href="http://www.usccb.org/about/leadership/holy-see/francis/papal-visit-2015/history-papal-visits-to-united-states.cfm"&gt;fourth pope to visit the United States&lt;/a&gt;, in a highly anticipated tour that took him from &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/22/pope-visit-washington-new-york-philadelphia-united-states/72073294/"&gt;D.C. to New York, with a Philadelphia stop&lt;/a&gt; still to come. Every day of his visit has brought headlines and curious searches (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Pope+Francis&amp;amp;std=20150922&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150922-Pope+Francis"&gt;more than 500K on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;)—and he’s been busy. He met with President Obama (&lt;a href="https://instagram.com/p/8CZ-6uwisB/?taken-by=whitehouse"&gt;and the President’s dogs&lt;/a&gt;) at the White House, stopped by the Capitol to give a &lt;a href="http://time.com/4048176/pope-francis-us-visit-congress-transcript/"&gt;joint address to Congress&lt;/a&gt; (the first time a pontiff has ever done so), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/647086691656663040"&gt;canonized Junipero Serra&lt;/a&gt;, visited the 9/11 Memorial, spoke at the United Nations and made statements on everything ranging from climate change to the refugee crisis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, people have been asking all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/646354293939830784"&gt;sorts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/647085711053619201"&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; about the Pope and his visit. Perhaps the most interesting—and inspiring—searches about the Pope’s visit are those looking for information on what he has said. Notably, people wanted to learn more about Thomas Merton and Dorothy Day, whom the Pope described in his joint address to Congress as Americans who had “built a better future” through “hard work and self-sacrifice” (the other two Americans he mentioned? Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.).  In fact, searches for Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and an advocate for social justice, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/647103535130152961"&gt;spiked 1700x&lt;/a&gt; after the Pope discussed her in his speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lKb1Ci1DyMY/VgXIBsaKFyI/AAAAAAAARLc/QvpWl2sipI4/s1600/pope%2Bquotes.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lKb1Ci1DyMY/VgXIBsaKFyI/AAAAAAAARLc/QvpWl2sipI4/s640/pope%2Bquotes.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It ain’t over ‘til it’s over&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week baseball fans and others said farewell to Yankees catcher &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Yogi+Berra&amp;amp;std=20150923&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150923-Yogi+Berra"&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt;, who died at age 90. A Hall of Famer who appeared in 21 World Series as a player, coach and manager, Yogi was perhaps best known for his nonsensical, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=koans"&gt;koan-like&lt;/a&gt; statements (some of which it’s disputed he actually made, but all of which you’ve probably said without even knowing their origin), and as the namesake for the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=yogi%20bear"&gt;cartoon bear&lt;/a&gt;. As news spread of his death, people searched for him more than 1M times, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/646726897217376256"&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt; “What number was Yogi Berra?” and “How did Yogi Berra get the name Yogi?” (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/sports/baseball/yogi-berra-dies-at-90-yankees-baseball-catcher.html"&gt;It’s a good story&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Emily Wood, Managing Editor, who searched this week for [pontifex] and [postpositive adjective]&lt;/span&gt;</content>

        <title type="text">Through the Google Lens: Search Trends July 31 - August 7</title>
        <content type="html">Has it been a week or what? It most definitely has, which means it’s time to kick back, relax and read on as we dig into Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends"&gt;trending searches list&lt;/a&gt; to find out what the world wanted to learn more about this week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Grand Old Party&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 10 candidates on stage for the prime-time event, Thursday night’s &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_pMFd-k4BAAC3uM_en"&gt;Republican presidential debate&lt;/a&gt; debate did seem quite a bit like a party. An estimated &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/republican-debate-shatters-fox-news-rating-record-24-million-watched-n406121"&gt;24 million people&lt;/a&gt; tuned in to watch the broadcast on the Fox News Channel (a record for the network, and cable TV, it turns out), and searches for “Republican debate” &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Republican+Debate&amp;amp;std=20150805&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150805-Republican+Debate"&gt;topped 5 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, the candidates themselves generated some serious search action. Donald Trump claimed the “most searched” position in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/629490415180210176"&gt;days before and hours after&lt;/a&gt; the event, and held on to the spot for nearly all of the debate itself, save a few appearances from Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xyd8pf8QUwQ/VcVO5F07_sI/AAAAAAAAQvQ/_yrp8xDAPhI/s1600/GOPall.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xyd8pf8QUwQ/VcVO5F07_sI/AAAAAAAAQvQ/_yrp8xDAPhI/s1600/GOPall.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;See a full-size version of this incredible data viz &lt;a href="http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/view?urls=All%20candidates%7Chttp:%2F%2Fgoogletrends.github.io%2FGOPDebate1%2FFullCandidates.html,Main%20debate%7Chttp:%2F%2Fgoogletrends.github.io%2FGOPDebate1%2FMainDebateCandidates.html,Issues%7Chttp:%2F%2Fgoogletrends.github.io%2FGOPDebate1%2FMainDebateIssues.html,Early%20debate%7Chttp:%2F%2Fgoogletrends.github.io%2FGOPDebate1%2FEarlyDebateCandidates.html&amp;amp;layout=narrative&amp;amp;theme=default&amp;amp;title=Early%20GOP%20debate:%20%20who%20was%20top%20searched%3F&amp;amp;description=Changing%20ranks%20of%20Republican%20candidates%20in%20the%20debate%20on%20Google%20search"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can also explore the most searched issues during the debate as well -- education, taxes and abortion all took turns in the top spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon-Voyage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All good things come to an end, and this week the world &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_BTmo_04BAADjRM_en"&gt;said goodbye to Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; -- at least as host of The Daily Show. Airing just moments after a debate that was ripe for Stewart’s particular brand of editorializing, Thursday night’s show was his last. Searches for the (now former) host &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Jon+Stewart&amp;amp;std=20150806&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150806-Jon+Stewart"&gt;topped 500,000&lt;/a&gt; this week.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YPxw4nid2WU/VcVPUY6NDxI/AAAAAAAAQvc/anFQCtiNBrE/s1600/JonStewart.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YPxw4nid2WU/VcVPUY6NDxI/AAAAAAAAQvc/anFQCtiNBrE/s640/JonStewart.png" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Check out another cool data viz -- this one on search interest in Jon Stewart across the United States -- &lt;a href="https://googledataorg.cartodb.com/u/googledata/viz/ad51240a-3ade-11e5-b67c-42010a149c0c/embed_map"&gt;right here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Doctor is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist turned producer turned mogul Dr. Dre gave us all a gift this week -- his first new album in 16 years. Compton -- which Dre is &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/08/07/430332000/after-16-years-dr-dre-returns-with-compton"&gt;calling his grand finale &lt;/a&gt;-- is self-reflective and grand in all the best ways, and dripping with appearances and collaborations from generations of other artists. It also brought in an impressive &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?stt=Dr+Dre+Compton&amp;amp;std=20150806&amp;amp;pn=p1#a=20150806-Dr+Dre+Compton"&gt;200,000 searches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Makeups and breakups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing what seems like a very common theme this summer, the week’s trending searches had no shortage of celebrity couple gossip.
